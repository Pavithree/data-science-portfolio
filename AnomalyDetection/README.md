**About**\
This project aims at finding unsual behaviour or anamoly in the sensor readings of around 55 sensors which monitors the state of pump. This project is especially useful in manufacturing industries, where there will be huge loss or injuries caused by outbreak of machinery. By constant monitoring of these sensor state, we can try and detect anamolies and prevent such outbreaks.
